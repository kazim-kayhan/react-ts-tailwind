## Why

I recently created several React apps, and the config setup was a bottleneck for me to quickly bring my ideas to life. To make the process easier, I created this starter template which includes some of the best practices I've learned from creating those apps. Feel free to customize it, star it, or even maintain your own fork.


## Usage

### Development

Just run and visit http://127.0.0.1:5173/

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Build

To build the App, run

```bash
yarn build
```

And you will see the generated file in `dist` that ready to be served.


### Husky

If pre-commit hooks are not working be sure that you have installed husky: `husky install`.

By default this command should be triggered after yarn/npm deps are installed.
